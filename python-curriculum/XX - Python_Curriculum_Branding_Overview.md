Welcome to the Python Bootcamp! We're so glad you joined us.

According to many, Python is the most popular and sought after programming language in the contemporary workplace. Python is a versatile and ubiquitous programming language that will help you navigate day-to-day tasks with logic. I hope this jumpstarts your interest in continuing education; at the very least, it will immediately boost your analytical "toolbox" and add tangible value to your team.

Throughout the course, feel free to engage me with any questions that come up. Your peers will be critical in contextualizing problems / issues / bugs that arise; you should work with them and utilize the vast open-source community available at your fingertips. There's nothing wrong with the 'ole Google search.



#Structure:
Over the next 18 weeks, we'll dive into the fundamentals of Python as a cohort. We'll take 30 minutes every two weeks (for a total of 9 classes) to work together in a more traditional lecture format. I'll overview concepts, address FAQs, and showcase technologies.

Every class will have additional coursework that MUST be completed in order to move on to the next session. It's necessary that we maximize time spent together as a cohort; two weeks of interim time between sessions is more than enough to finish assignments. These are to be completed on your own time.

#Material:
1. Python fundamentals
  -- 4 total sessions
    -- Download / Installation & "Hello World" with real-life examples
    -- Data types & variables
    -- Basic functions
    -- Script organization, access / upload to GitHub
2. Pandas
  -- 2 total sessions
    -- Dataframes and analysis
    -- Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Matplotlib
  -- 2 total sessions
    -- Basic plotting and graphing types
    -- Exploratory Data Analysis
4. APIs
  -- 1 session
    -- Hooking into data sources; resources; Postman
5. Final Project
  -- Flexible
    -- Apply to a use-case of your choosing. Articulate value, test hypothesis, document success!

#Technology
1. Python
2. Anaconda (referred to as Conda)
3. GitHub
4. Basic command-line terminal
5. Jupyter Notebooks??? (IDK just yet)

#Deliverables:
At the end of this Bootcamp, you'll be able to use Python to perform basic tasks. Your newly acquired technical skills will help you navigate complexity with logic, conceptualizing how programming can automate and/or streamline processes. The final project will contextualize Python and other tools, and provide immediate cost and/or time savings to an aspect of your work. I'm hopeful this encourages you to continue learning!
