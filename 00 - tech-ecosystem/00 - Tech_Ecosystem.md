# Welcome  
This document provides an overview of the technology you'll need to build effective tools for Advanced Analytics & Data Science. This overview is tailored for agnostic development environments, and should be distributed with the understanding that content may fluctuate with movement in the technology landscape. At the time of writing, all tools are free and open source.

# Tools:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
At the time of writing, Python is the most popular programming language for data professionals. Python is a versatile and ubiquitous programming language with an incredible open-source community of developers and resources at your fingertips. Python can be easily applied to explore and solve unlimited applications with scale. Python files are saved via .py convention.

2. [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
GitHub is the world's leading software development platform. It's known mainly for powerful version control across distributed software teams, but it's basically a cloud database for code, resources, tutorials, etc. We'll use GitHub to host this curriculum, share resources across computers and collaborate in a trusted environment (will scale to suit teams of any size). GitHub has online and desktop applications for ease-of-use.

3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
Git is a free and open-source language for interacting with GitHub. It's basically GitHub's tool for fast and efficient interactions; the online and desktop platforms can be difficult to use with different applications - Git solves this confusion. We access Git from the Command-Line-Interface (CLI) / Terminal.

4. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)  
Anaconda is a platform that helps consolidate and manage computing libraries, packages and tools (within the open-source community). Anaconda streamlines environment set-up for new users so that ALL developers understand and interact with the correct code. If a teammate is using Python version 2.7 and you're using Python 3.7, the code will not work. Anaconda confirms that everyone is using the same technology, in an easy-to-use and distribute platform.

5. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)  
Conda is an open source package management system to quickly install, run and update packages and their dependencies. We use Conda to interact with Anaconda; similar to using git to access GitHub. We access Conda from the Command-Line-Interface (CLI) / Terminal.  
[Popular Conda Commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html).

6. IDE  
An Integrated Development Environment is a software application for computer programmers to interact and edit code. Typically, an IDE streamlines access to editors, build tools, debugging, etc. A few IDE's that are recommended:  

  * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/anaconda/)  
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code comes with Anaconda Distribution)    


7. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)  
Juputer notebooks help organize code similar to an IDE. Jupyter structures code into kernels which can be run independently of the other, making presentation / communication of code highly effective. The critical distinction: IDE's are helpful to build code, Jupyter is helpful to demonstrate code. Jupyter Notebooks come with standard Anaconda Distribution, and can be launched easily from the Anaconda desktop app. Notebooks are saved via .ipynb convention.

8. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (optional)  
Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. They have an easy-to-use desktop app for formatting and building API connections.
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

9. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  
MongoDB is a cross-platform document oriented database, known specifically for application development and programming. There are multiple components:  
  * [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is the fully managed cloud database built for cloud-agnostic computing. Currently, we have 10GB hosted on AWS via MongoDB Atlas. Atlas makes scalability, availability and compliance easy to manage.   
  * [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is the visual Graphical User Interface (GUI) to explore data in MongoDB. You can run queries, interact with data, and view performance from the Compass GUI.  


10. [Studio3T](https://studio3t.com/) (optional)  
Studio3T is a professional GUI developed for MongoDB beginners. The application assists with query building, data exploration, import/export, code generation, etc. Studio3T is wonderful for building NoSQL queries and translating in Python code.

11. [Atom](https://atom.io/) (optional)  
Atom is a hackable text editor for configuring code outside of the development environment. You can use the native text editor or a different configurable editor; Atom is preferred because it integrates with GitHub and has grammar detection (among many other great features).
