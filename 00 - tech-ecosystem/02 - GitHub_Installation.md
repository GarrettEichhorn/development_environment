# Installing GitHub

1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/)  

2. Create an account! Click the 'Sign Up' link and enter a username / email / password  

3. Choose a plan: "Individual" -- "Free"  

4. Follow the prompt complete account setup. Confirm your account via email  

5. Create a new repository:    

  * Include a relevant name, description  
  * Make the repository public    
  * Initialize the repo with a README  
  * Create!  

6. Navigate to your instructor's version of `development_environment` and `fork` the repository. Forking will create a new copy of the repository to your GitHub account:
`{your_name}/development_environment`  

7. In **your** repo, click the "Clone or download" button and copy the connection string for "Clone with HTTPS". You may use an SSH key if you're familiar; otherwise, please use HTTPS  

8. Minimize all windows until you reach your Desktop screen. Right-click your Desktop screen to create a new folder and name it `github_repositories`

8. Save the connection string to a text editor of your choosing. I recommend Notepad or Microsoft Word. Save this file inside your new folder `github_repositories`
