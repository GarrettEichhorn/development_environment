# Installing git

1. Navigate to [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  

2. Launch the installer for Windows. The download should start automatically.  

3. Follow the prompt to setup:  

  * Agree to terms / select native destination
  * Add - additional icons "On the Desktop"
  * Remove - Git GUI here
  * Adjust your path environment so "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
  * Click through on all native settings to launch the installer

4. Launch Git Bash! (uncheck "View Release Notes")

5. Navigate to your `github_repositories` folder. There should only be one file inside - a text file that contains a connection string to your forked copy of `development_environment`

6. In your new `git bash` window, please enter:  
 `git clone https://github.com/{your_name}/development_environment.git`. You must replace the HTTPS link with **your** copied connection string.

7. Your `github_repositories` folder will now contain all relevant information you need to navigate the installation process for the development environment.
